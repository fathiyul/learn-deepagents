# LangChain Deep Agents

Core capabilities of Deep Agents
- Planning and task decomposition: include a built-in [`write_todos`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#to-do-list)
- Context management: [file system tools](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/harness#file-system-access) (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`)
- Pluggable filesystem backends
- Subagent spawning: built-in `task` tool 
- Long-term memory: using LangGraph’s [Memory Store](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#memory-store)
